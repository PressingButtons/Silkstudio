# Silk - Javascript Game Independent Development Environment

**01/01/2021 - First Journal Entry - About the project

I've wanted to embark on something like this for quite a while, I'm committed to making a game in javascript.
As my attempts progress, the dire need for having a system that could help manage the process became more evident.
At frist it started with trying to create a character editor. I needed to animate and provide hit regions for each frame.
While possible to calculate and code each from painstakingly from a text editor, it was time consuming and quit frankly boring.
This lead to the idea of creating an application to which I could load an image, separate into key frames and create animations.
Of course this project lend itself into expansion; what about recolors, what about bringing in other objects, layers, how would this fit into an overall game project?

Thus the question/need shifted to making the project itself. What do I need from an editor to create a game.

* A graphical interface
* The ability to create objects
* The ability to create scenes
* The ability to compile and package a project

Some high level aspects that will be broken into as the project develops

The first push of this project will feature the original template, the character editor.
Drastic changes will be made in post.



*** A long time coming *** 

08/26/2022 - Second Journal Entry - Burn it all down

It's been a while since I tried to perform any updates to this studio project. 
After more solo development, I'd like to redo much I've what I've attempted here. 
Silk Studio will have a more moduluar approach and focus on two things. Tilemaps and Sprite Objects.
As such a complete overhaul is required.
